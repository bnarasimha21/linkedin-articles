## LinkedIn Formatting Rules

When preparing articles for LinkedIn, follow these rules:

### What LinkedIn DOES NOT support:
- Markdown headers (# ## ###)
- Code blocks (```)
- Tables
- Hyperlinked text [text](url)
- Bold/italic markdown syntax

### What LinkedIn DOES support:
- Plain text
- Line breaks (use liberally)
- Bullet points (• or -)
- Arrows (→)
- Emojis (great for section headers)
- Em dashes (—) for section breaks
- Hashtags at the end

### Formatting Pattern:

```
Title (plain text, no #)

Opening hook (2-3 sentences max)

—

🎯 Section Header (emoji + text, no markdown)

Short paragraph (2-3 sentences).

Key points:
→ Point one
→ Point two
→ Point three

—

🚀 Next Section

More content...

—

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### Style Guidelines:
1. Keep paragraphs SHORT (2-3 sentences max)
2. Use line breaks between paragraphs
3. Use — (em dash) as section dividers
4. Start sections with relevant emoji
5. Use → for lists instead of bullets when showing flow
6. Use • for unordered lists
7. End with 3-6 relevant hashtags
8. No em dashes within sentences (Narsi's preference)
9. Write conversationally, not formally

## X (Twitter) Formatting Rules

X has two formats: **Threads** (multiple tweets) or **Long-form posts** (X Premium).

### Thread Format (Recommended for articles):

```
1/🧵 Hook that grabs attention in first line

The problem or insight (keep under 280 chars total)

2/ Second point

Expand on the idea. One concept per tweet.

3/ Continue the story...

Each tweet should stand alone but flow together.

4/ Key insight or turning point

This is where you deliver value.

5/ Conclusion + CTA

What should people do next?

Try it: [link]
```

### Thread Rules:
1. First tweet is EVERYTHING (hook must grab attention)
2. One idea per tweet
3. 280 characters max per tweet
4. Number format: "1/🧵" for first, "2/" "3/" etc for rest
5. No hashtags mid-thread (maybe 1-2 at the end)
6. Last tweet = call to action or link
7. Use line breaks within tweets for readability

### Long-form Post (X Premium):
- Up to 25,000 characters
- Similar to LinkedIn but more casual
- Shorter paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- More punchy, less formal
- Fewer emojis than LinkedIn
- Can include images inline

### Tone Differences:
| LinkedIn | X |
|----------|---|
| Professional | Casual |
| "I discovered..." | "I found this..." |
| Detailed explanation | Quick hits |
| Humble expertise | Hot takes OK |
| Formal CTA | "Try it 👇" |

## File Naming Convention

For each article, create these versions:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `XX-article-name.md` | Source (full markdown) |
| `XX-article-name-linkedin.txt` | LinkedIn copy-paste |
| `XX-article-name-x-thread.txt` | X thread format |

---

## Workflow

1. Write article in markdown (for GitHub/blog)
2. Create `-linkedin.txt` version
3. Create `-x-thread.txt` version
4. User can copy-paste directly to each platform

1/🧵 I made a video with React and Claude.

No video editor. No timeline dragging. Just code.

Here's how Remotion + Claude Code changed my workflow:

2/ Remotion lets you create videos in React.

Scenes = components
Timing = frames
Output = MP4

As a developer, this just makes sense.

3/ But Remotion has a learning curve.

useCurrentFrame(), interpolate(), <Sequence>...

That's where Claude comes in.

4/ I describe what I want:

"Create a scene where the title types out character by character with a blinking cursor, then badges fade in below"

Claude generates the component. Handles the math. Sets up animations.

5/ When something doesn't look right, I just say:

"make it feel snappier"
"the text reveal should be more dramatic"

Claude translates intent into code.

6/ Matching animations to voiceover?

Instead of calculating that 3.5 seconds at 30fps = 105 frames...

I just say "this scene should be 3.5 seconds"

Claude handles it.

7/ Unexpected win: thumbnails.

Remotion can render single frames as images.

Same design system. Same fonts. Same colors as the video.

One command: npx remotion still Thumbnail out/thumbnail.png

8/ Why not Canva?

Canva = you do the layout work in a GUI

Remotion + Claude = you describe what you want, review the output

The code → preview → iterate loop is fast.

9/ Want to try it?

npx create-video@latest

I went from zero Remotion experience to a polished video in a few hours.

If you use Claude Code or Cursor, you'll love this workflow.

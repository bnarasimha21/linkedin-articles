AI agents load skills to gain new capabilities. But every skill is also a set of instructions the model will follow. They are instruction carriers.

Every web search, every tool call, every page the agent reads is a potential injection surface.

Many people run OpenClaw on personal machines. If you understand security policies and know what to enable, that setup unlocks a great deal.
But if you would rather not take that risk, running in a sandboxed cloud environment like DigitalOcean's one-click OpenClaw instance (marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/openclaw) is a great option. Isolated containers, small blast radius, and you can still do a lot.

Either way, know the risks. I wrote a deeper breakdown of the attack surface and mitigations.

Take a look.
